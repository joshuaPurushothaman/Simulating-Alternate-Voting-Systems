# Simulating Alternate Voting Systems, inspired by Primer

Simulations of various voting systems, including:

- None yet :)

Based on Primer's video on simulating alternate voting systems shown [here](https://youtu.be/yhO6jfHPFQU).

## Installation

If you want to use a virtual environment, activate it first.

Run this command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

If you're using VSCode, you can run the simulation by pressing `F5`.
If you're using the command line, you can run the simulation by running `python3 main.py`.

To change the simulation parameters, edit `config.py`.

- The comments in that file should be self-explanatory.
